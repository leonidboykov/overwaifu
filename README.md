# OverWaifu

Everybody can visit https://overbuff.com/heroes and check the most popular
character according to pick rate, win rate etc. However, OW represents 25
different characters with the different looks, nature and spirit. I started this
project to determine the most popular/unpopular characters according their
off-gaming stats, i.e. popularity between artists (as first step).

## Sources

* Sankaku Channel

Score calculates only by tag count, tranding calculations cooming soon:

> i.e. 100 per 5days > 200 per 20days

The only source available for now is Sankaku's channel. I'll add more sources
such as Overbuff, Google Trends and etc.

Only female characters for now (to reduce typing).
