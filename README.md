# OverWaifu

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/overwaifu/overwaifu.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/overwaifu/overwaifu)

Everybody can visit https://overbuff.com/heroes and check the most popular
character according to pick rate, win rate etc. However, OW represents 25
different characters with the different looks, nature and spirit. I started this
project to determine the most popular/unpopular characters according their
off-gaming stats, i.e. popularity between artists (as first step).

## Sources

* Sankaku Channel

Score calculates only by tag count, tranding calculations coming soon:

> i.e. 100 per 5days > 200 per 20days

The only source available for now is Sankaku's channel. I'll add more sources
such as Overbuff, Google Trends and etc.

Only female characters for now (to reduce typing).

## Results

Right now, the result looks like

    D.Va - 5239
    Mercy - 4348
    Widowmaker - 3326
    Tracer - 3242
    Mei - 2568
    Pharah - 1972
    Sombra - 863
    Symmetra - 692
    Ana - 685
    Zarya - 588

    D.Va is the hottest female in the Overwatch
